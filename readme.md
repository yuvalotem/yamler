## Yamler

This sdk is used to convert yaml files into plain html
You can find the example under src folder

## How to start

In order to build the project you can run npm run build:example in the root of the project

Then open the index.html file inside your dist folder in the root in the browser and see the output off the yaml files inside the src folder

Enjoy coding in a new way!

## Road map
1. Support js scripts inside the yaml files
2. Find a generic covenant way to handle state (props/store/etc...)
3. Publish to npm
4. Support configuration file
5. Convert sdk code to ts and make the config file with type support
6. Support local server with hmr to improve dev expiriance
